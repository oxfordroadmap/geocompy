## Setting Up Your Conda Environment in VS Code

### 🧭 Step 1: Activate Your Conda Environment

Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Miniconda Prompt) and run:

```bash
conda activate mygeocompy
```

Replace `mygeocompy` with your actual environment name if different.

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Open VS Code and Select the Interpreter

1. Launch VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the **Command Palette**
3. Type: `Python: Select Interpreter`
4. Choose the one that points to:
   ```
   C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\envs\mygeocompy\python.exe
   ```

If it doesn’t show up:
- Click “Enter interpreter path”
- Browse manually to the path above

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Verify It’s Working

Open a `.py` file and run:

```python
import sys
print(sys.executable)
```

You should see the path to your Conda environment’s Python.

---

### 🧰 Optional: Create a `.vscode/settings.json` File

This locks your project to the environment:

```json
{
  "python.pythonPath": "C:\\ProgramData\\miniconda3\\envs\\mygeocompy\\python.exe",
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
}
```

Save this inside your project folder under `.vscode/settings.json`.

---
## full `environment.yml`
Awesome, Liao! Here's a complete `environment.yml` template you can use to recreate and share your Conda setup—optimized for VS Code and Quarto rendering with Python 3.13:

```yaml
name: mygeocompy
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.13
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - jupyter
  - ipykernel
  - quarto-cli
  - scipy
  - pip
  - pip:
      - bleach-with-css
      - jsonschema-with-format-nongpl
```

### 🧪 How to Use It

1. Save the above as `environment.yml` in your project folder.
2. Create the environment from it:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
3. Activate:
   ```bash
   conda activate mygeocompy
   ```
4. Then make sure VS Code is using `mygeocompy` as its interpreter.

### 🧪 Actual Use 
* `environment.yml` already exists
* VS Code is set up to use  `mygeocompy` as its interpreter
